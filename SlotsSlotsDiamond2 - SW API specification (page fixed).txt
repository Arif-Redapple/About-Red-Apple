    1. API Overview
The SlotsDiamond2 SW API is a unified backend solution that enables gaming platforms to seamlessly interact with multiple game providers through a single integration. It is divided into two key components: one focused on secure, real-time wallet transactions, and another dedicated to dynamic game data and content delivery, which refers to Seamless Wallet API and Data Integration API. Together, they provide a consistent and scalable interface for managing gameplay operations, financial transactions, and content synchronization across diverse provider systems.

By abstracting provider-specific logic, the SlotsDiamond2 SW API simplifies integration and ensures a standardized experience regardless of the underlying game source. It supports a wide range of real-time operations, including player session handling, wallet synchronization, and retrieval of game metadata and configurations-all without requiring direct communication with each individual provider.

Security is a core part of the platform, with protections such as hash-based request validation and IP whitelisting to ensure integrity and prevent unauthorized access. The API adheres to RESTful design principles, delivering stateless, JSON-based communication and clear HTTP status handling. Built for performance and reliability, the SlotsDiamond2 SW API empowers gaming platforms to scale efficiently while maintaining full control over financial flows and game content delivery.

        1.1 Seamless Wallet API
The Seamless Wallet API Service is a centralized API solution that manages all critical wallet transactions required during gameplay, including user authentication, balance verification, bet placement, win processing, refunds, bulk operations, and session settlement. It is designed to provide a smooth, secure, and real-time transactional experience, enabling consistent wallet behavior across various games and providers.

        1.2 Data Integration API
The Data Integration API provides real-time access to dynamic game-related data, including game categories, provider information, game listings, popular and upcoming titles, player bet history, round details, credit limits, and available bet ranges. It enables platforms to keep their game catalogs updated, personalize user experiences, and maintain seamless synchronization with provider content.

    2. Seamless Wallet API Services
The Seamless Wallet API supports a full range of real-time wallet operations essential for gaming platforms, including secure player authentication, balance verification, bet deductions, win payouts, refunds, and session settlements. It also enables efficient handling of high-volume transactions through bulk operations, allowing multiple bets, wins, or refunds to be processed in a single request. This ensures consistent wallet behavior across games and providers while optimizing performance under load.

Security is enforced through MD5-based request hashing, combined with IP whitelisting to restrict access to trusted sources. This approach safeguards data integrity and prevents unauthorized access, ensuring all wallet transactions are securely validated.

Designed around RESTful principles, the Seamless Wallet API uses stateless communication, clean JSON responses, and standardized HTTP status codes to simplify integration and ensure consistency. Whether supporting single-game transactions or complex multi-provider ecosystems, it delivers the control, security, and scalability required for modern real-money gaming platforms.

HTTP Method Used
    • POST: Used for user authentication, retrieving balance, processing bets and wins, issuing refunds, handling bulk transactions (bet, win, refund), and finalizing game settlements.

Request Headers
Most APIs in this service require the following headers:

http

Content-Type: application/json

    • Content-Type: Specifies that the request body is in JSON format.

Response Headers
All responses will include:

http
Content-Type: application/json
    • Content-Type: Ensures the response format remains consistent.
Security Measures
    • MD5-based Hashing: Ensures secure access to protected endpoints.
    • SECRET_KEY: Merchant will provide the value of secret key at the time of Onboarding.

Hash code is calculated with following formula:
From request post parameters, all parameters are taken (except hash) and appending to string:

    1. Sort all parameters by keys in alphabetical order.
    2. Append them (if the value is not null or empty) in key1=value1&key2=value2.
    3. Append secret_key, e.g.: key1=value1&key2=value2SECRET_KEY.
    4. Calculate the hash by using MD5.
    5. Compare with hash parameter. In the case of failure, Operator should send the error code 1013.
Example:

    1. Sort all expected parameters by keys in alphabetical order.

ini
bet_amount=199 category_id=66b5be786a68c2e9bbb5296e game_id=66b5f86fe5c3936dcce51073 round_id=157887124 txn_id=1001578870000007943180
user_id=f7ed416e

    2. Append them (if the value is not null or empty) in key1=value1&key2=value2.

ini
bet_amount=199&category_id=66b5be786a68c2e9bbb5296e&game_id=66b5f86fe5c3936dcce51073 &round_id=157887124&txn_id=1001578870000007943180&user_id=f7ed416e

    3. Append secret_key, e.g.: key1=value1&key2=value2SECRET_KEY.

ini
bet_amount=199&category_id=66b5be786a68c2e9bbb5296e&game_id=66b5f86fe5c3936dcce51073 &round_id=157887124&txn_id=1001578870000007943180&user_id=f7ed416eSECRET_KEY

    4. Calculate MD5 hash of the entire string.

ini
MD5(bet_amount=199&category_id=66b5be786a68c2e9bbb5296e&game_id=66b5f86fe5c3936dcce5 1073&round_id=157887124&txn_id=1001578870000007943180&user_id=f7ed416eSECRET_KEY)

You'll get a 32-character hash (e.g. 0aa56fb3e00894da9e3bbff34d9e14c3). Now, the hash has been generated and added to the request body. The example request body is as followed:

json
{
"user_id": "f7ed416e",
"game_id": "66b5f86fe5c3936dcce51073", "category_id": "66b5be786a68c2e9bbb5296e", "round_id": "157887124",
"txn_id": "1001578870000007943180",
"bet_amount": "199",
"hash": "0aa56fb3e00894da9e3bbff34d9e14c3"
}

    5. Validate the request by comparing the received hash with the generated hash.


NOTE: The {{operator_endpoint}} is the primary interface through which merchant initiate real-time wallet operations with operators. Operators must provide this endpoint during onboarding to enable smooth integration and ensure consistent, low-latency processing of transactions across gaming sessions.

The txn_id must be unique for each transaction, ensuring that no transaction is processed more than once. However, the round_id can be the same across multiple transactions, as they may correspond to different bet instances in the same game round.
The operator is responsible for validating that none of the provided txn_ids have been processed before. If any transaction in the request fails (due to a duplicate txn_id, invalid data, or any other issue), the entire request should fail, and no winnings should be credited.

The operator must validate that each transaction ID corresponds to a valid and refundable bet. All refunds in the request are processed as a single atomic operation-if any one of the transactions is invalid or not eligible for a refund, the entire request must be rejected, and no changes should be made to the player’s balance. The operator should also ensure that none of the txn_ids have already been refunded.

Description:
The Settlement API is used to credit or debit a specific amount to/from a player’s wallet outside the regular betting flow. This may include operations such as rewards, bonuses, manual adjustments, or other provider-specific settlements.
Each settlement request includes a unique txn_id, the amount to be adjusted, the txn_type (indicating the nature of the transaction debit/credit), and the provider_id responsible for the adjustment. The operator is expected to process the settlement, apply the amount accordingly, and return the updated balance along with a transaction reference.

    3. Data Integration API Services
The Data Integration API offers a comprehensive suite of real-time operations tailored to meet the evolving demands of gaming platforms. It facilitates seamless communication between systems through endpoints that deliver essential data such as provider lists, game categories, and the complete game catalog. The API also supports fetching the most popular and upcoming games, accessing user-specific bet histories, and retrieving detailed round information for transparency and compliance. A key feature includes the ability to generate secure, session-specific game launch URLs. This enables operators to offer a streamlined gameplay experience, precise user activity tracking, and reliable integration with various third-party providers-all through a unified and consistent interface.
To maintain high levels of security, the API implements MD5-based hashing for request validation and enforces IP whitelisting to ensure that only trusted sources can access its endpoints. This dual-layered protection guards against unauthorized access and ensures the integrity of every transaction.
Adhering to RESTful architecture, the Data Integration API utilizes stateless communication, provides structured JSON responses, and follows standard HTTP status codes for clarity and consistency. Whether it's powering single game sessions or managing integrations across multiple providers, the API offers the reliability, security, and scalability essential for today’s gaming platforms.


HTTP Method Used
    • POST: Used to perform various operations such as retrieving the list of game providers, game categories, available games, upcoming games, and popular games. It is also utilized to generate a game launch URL for a specific game session. Additionally, POST requests enable fetching the bet history of a user within a specified time range, accessing detailed records of a particular game round, and retrieving the current credit balance of an account. These operations support dynamic, real-time data access essential for delivering a seamless and engaging gaming experience.

Request Headers
Most APIs in this service require the following headers:

http

Content-Type: application/json

    • Content-Type: Specifies that the request body is in JSON format.
Response Headers
All responses will include:

http
Content-Type: application/json
    • Content-Type: Ensures the response format remains consistent.

Security Measures
    • MD5-based Hashing: Ensures secure access to protected endpoints.
    • SECRET_KEY: Merchant will provide the value of secret key at the time of Onboarding.

Hash code is calculated with following formula:

    1. Sort all parameters by keys in alphabetical order.
    2. Append them (if the value is not null or empty) in key1=value1&key2=value2.
    3. Append secret_key, e.g.: key1=value1&key2=value2SECRET_KEY.
    4. Calculate the hash by using MD5.
Example:

    1. Sort all expected parameters by keys in alphabetical order.

ini
"account_id":"66b4a0a159098a5df1280c9a", "language":"en",
“request_id” :”777”

    2. Append them (if the value is not null or empty) in key1=value1&key2=value2.

ini
account_id=66b4a0a159098a5df1280c9a&language=en&request_id=777

    3. Append secret_key, e.g.: key1=value1&key2=value2SECRET_KEY.

ini
account_id=66b4a0a159098a5df1280c9a&language=en&request_id=777SECRET_KEY


    4. Calculate MD5 hash of the entire string.

ini
MD5(account_id=66b4a0a159098a5df1280c9a&language=en&request_id=777SECRET_KEY)

You'll get a 32-character hash (e.g. 0aa56fb3e00894da9e3bbff34d9e14c3). Now, the hash has been generated, add it to the request body. The example request body is now as followed:

json
{
"language":"en", "account_id":"66b4a0a159098a5df1280c9a", “request_id” : “777”, "hash":"d535adc10df8e6c5b0e82f4dee3cad62"
}


Note: The {{merchant_endpoint}} is the callback interface through which operators receive real-time game-related data from the merchant. This endpoint will be provided by the merchant during onboarding, facilitating seamless synchronization of game catalogs and provider content via the Data Integration API.

    1. API Overview
The SlotsDiamond2 SW API is a unified backend solution that enables gaming platforms to seamlessly interact with multiple game providers through a single integration. It is divided into two key components: one focused on secure, real-time wallet transactions, and another dedicated to dynamic game data and content delivery, which refers to Seamless Wallet API and Data Integration API. Together, they provide a consistent and scalable interface for managing gameplay operations, financial transactions, and content synchronization across diverse provider systems.

By abstracting provider-specific logic, the SlotsDiamond2 SW API simplifies integration and ensures a standardized experience regardless of the underlying game source. It supports a wide range of real-time operations, including player session handling, wallet synchronization, and retrieval of game metadata and configurations-all without requiring direct communication with each individual provider.

Security is a core part of the platform, with protections such as hash-based request validation and IP whitelisting to ensure integrity and prevent unauthorized access. The API adheres to RESTful design principles, delivering stateless, JSON-based communication and clear HTTP status handling. Built for performance and reliability, the SlotsDiamond2 SW API empowers gaming platforms to scale efficiently while maintaining full control over financial flows and game content delivery.

        1.1 Seamless Wallet API
The Seamless Wallet API Service is a centralized API solution that manages all critical wallet transactions required during gameplay, including user authentication, balance verification, bet placement, win processing, refunds, bulk operations, and session settlement. It is designed to provide a smooth, secure, and real-time transactional experience, enabling consistent wallet behavior across various games and providers.

        1.2 Data Integration API
The Data Integration API provides real-time access to dynamic game-related data, including game categories, provider information, game listings, popular and upcoming titles, player bet history, round details, credit limits, and available bet ranges. It enables platforms to keep their game catalogs updated, personalize user experiences, and maintain seamless synchronization with provider content.

    2. Seamless Wallet API Services
The Seamless Wallet API supports a full range of real-time wallet operations essential for gaming platforms, including secure player authentication, balance verification, bet deductions, win payouts, refunds, and session settlements. It also enables efficient handling of high-volume transactions through bulk operations, allowing multiple bets, wins, or refunds to be processed in a single request. This ensures consistent wallet behavior across games and providers while optimizing performance under load.

Security is enforced through MD5-based request hashing, combined with IP whitelisting to restrict access to trusted sources. This approach safeguards data integrity and prevents unauthorized access, ensuring all wallet transactions are securely validated.

Designed around RESTful principles, the Seamless Wallet API uses stateless communication, clean JSON responses, and standardized HTTP status codes to simplify integration and ensure consistency. Whether supporting single-game transactions or complex multi-provider ecosystems, it delivers the control, security, and scalability required for modern real-money gaming platforms.

HTTP Method Used
    • POST: Used for user authentication, retrieving balance, processing bets and wins, issuing refunds, handling bulk transactions (bet, win, refund), and finalizing game settlements.

Request Headers
Most APIs in this service require the following headers:

http

Content-Type: application/json

    • Content-Type: Specifies that the request body is in JSON format.

Response Headers
All responses will include:

http
Content-Type: application/json
    • Content-Type: Ensures the response format remains consistent.
Security Measures
    • MD5-based Hashing: Ensures secure access to protected endpoints.
    • SECRET_KEY: Merchant will provide the value of secret key at the time of Onboarding.

Hash code is calculated with following formula:
From request post parameters, all parameters are taken (except hash) and appending to string:

    1. Sort all parameters by keys in alphabetical order.
    2. Append them (if the value is not null or empty) in key1=value1&key2=value2.
    3. Append secret_key, e.g.: key1=value1&key2=value2SECRET_KEY.
    4. Calculate the hash by using MD5.
    5. Compare with hash parameter. In the case of failure, Operator should send the error code 1013.
Example:

    1. Sort all expected parameters by keys in alphabetical order.

ini
bet_amount=199 category_id=66b5be786a68c2e9bbb5296e game_id=66b5f86fe5c3936dcce51073 round_id=157887124 txn_id=1001578870000007943180
user_id=f7ed416e

    2. Append them (if the value is not null or empty) in key1=value1&key2=value2.

ini
bet_amount=199&category_id=66b5be786a68c2e9bbb5296e&game_id=66b5f86fe5c3936dcce51073 &round_id=157887124&txn_id=1001578870000007943180&user_id=f7ed416e

    3. Append secret_key, e.g.: key1=value1&key2=value2SECRET_KEY.

ini
bet_amount=199&category_id=66b5be786a68c2e9bbb5296e&game_id=66b5f86fe5c3936dcce51073 &round_id=157887124&txn_id=1001578870000007943180&user_id=f7ed416eSECRET_KEY

    4. Calculate MD5 hash of the entire string.

ini
MD5(bet_amount=199&category_id=66b5be786a68c2e9bbb5296e&game_id=66b5f86fe5c3936dcce5 1073&round_id=157887124&txn_id=1001578870000007943180&user_id=f7ed416eSECRET_KEY)

You'll get a 32-character hash (e.g. 0aa56fb3e00894da9e3bbff34d9e14c3). Now, the hash has been generated and added to the request body. The example request body is as followed:

json
{
"user_id": "f7ed416e",
"game_id": "66b5f86fe5c3936dcce51073", "category_id": "66b5be786a68c2e9bbb5296e", "round_id": "157887124",
"txn_id": "1001578870000007943180",
"bet_amount": "199",
"hash": "0aa56fb3e00894da9e3bbff34d9e14c3"
}

    5. Validate the request by comparing the received hash with the generated hash.

The operator must validate that each transaction ID corresponds to a valid and refundable bet. All refunds in the request are processed as a single atomic operation-if any one of the transactions is invalid or not eligible for a refund, the entire request must be rejected, and no changes should be made to the player’s balance.

    3. Data Integration API Services
The Data Integration API offers a comprehensive suite of real-time operations tailored to meet the evolving demands of gaming platforms. It facilitates seamless communication between systems through endpoints that deliver essential data such as provider lists, game categories, and the complete game catalog. The API also supports fetching the most popular and upcoming games, accessing user-specific bet histories, and retrieving detailed round information for transparency and compliance. A key feature includes the ability to generate secure, session-specific game launch URLs. This enables operators to offer a streamlined gameplay experience, precise user activity tracking, and reliable integration with various third-party providers-all through a unified and consistent interface.
To maintain high levels of security, the API implements MD5-based hashing for request validation and enforces IP whitelisting to ensure that only trusted sources can access its endpoints. This dual-layered protection guards against unauthorized access and ensures the integrity of every transaction.
Adhering to RESTful architecture, the Data Integration API utilizes stateless communication, provides structured JSON responses, and follows standard HTTP status codes for clarity and consistency. Whether it's powering single game sessions or managing integrations across multiple providers, the API offers the reliability, security, and scalability essential for today’s gaming platforms.


HTTP Method Used
    • POST: Used to perform various operations such as retrieving the list of game providers, game categories, available games, upcoming games, and popular games. It is also utilized to generate a game launch URL for a specific game session. Additionally, POST requests enable fetching the bet history of a user within a specified time range, accessing detailed records of a particular game round, and retrieving the current credit balance of an account. These operations support dynamic, real-time data access essential for delivering a seamless and engaging gaming experience.

Request Headers
Most APIs in this service require the following headers:

http

Content-Type: application/json

    • Content-Type: Specifies that the request body is in JSON format.
Response Headers
All responses will include:

http
Content-Type: application/json
    • Content-Type: Ensures the response format remains consistent.

Security Measures
    • MD5-based Hashing: Ensures secure access to protected endpoints.
    • SECRET_KEY: Merchant will provide the value of secret key at the time of Onboarding.

Hash code is calculated with following formula:

    1. Sort all parameters by keys in alphabetical order.
    2. Append them (if the value is not null or empty) in key1=value1&key2=value2.
    3. Append secret_key, e.g.: key1=value1&key2=value2SECRET_KEY.
    4. Calculate the hash by using MD5.
Example:

    1. Sort all expected parameters by keys in alphabetical order.

ini
"account_id":"66b4a0a159098a5df1280c9a", "language":"en",
“request_id” :”777”

    2. Append them (if the value is not null or empty) in key1=value1&key2=value2.

ini
account_id=66b4a0a159098a5df1280c9a&language=en&request_id=777

    3. Append secret_key, e.g.: key1=value1&key2=value2SECRET_KEY.

ini
account_id=66b4a0a159098a5df1280c9a&language=en&request_id=777SECRET_KEY


    4. Calculate MD5 hash of the entire string.

ini
MD5(account_id=66b4a0a159098a5df1280c9a&language=en&request_id=777SECRET_KEY)

You'll get a 32-character hash (e.g. 0aa56fb3e00894da9e3bbff34d9e14c3). Now, the hash has been generated, add it to the request body. The example request body is now as followed:

json
{
"language":"en", "account_id":"66b4a0a159098a5df1280c9a", “request_id” : “777”, "hash":"d535adc10df8e6c5b0e82f4dee3cad62"
}


Note: The {{merchant_endpoint}} is the callback interface through which operators receive real-time game-related data from the merchant. This endpoint will be provided by the merchant during onboarding, facilitating seamless synchronization of game catalogs and provider content via the Data Integration API.
