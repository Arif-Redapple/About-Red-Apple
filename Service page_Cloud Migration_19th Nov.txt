Frequently Asked Questions
How do you evaluate whether our workloads are ready for migration?
We conduct a readiness assessment reviewing architecture, dependencies, performance, security, data sensitivity, and modernization needs.
Can you migrate without impacting our live operations?
Yes. We use replication, blue-green deployment, and phased migration strategies to minimize or eliminate downtime.
Will migration affect our security posture?
Security increases with cloud-native tools:
    • Identity management
    • Encryption
    • Access controls
    • Automated monitoring
    • Compliance-ready configuration
Do you support database migrations across different engines?
Yes. We handle homogeneous and heterogeneous migrations — e.g., SQL to PostgreSQL, Oracle to Aurora, MySQL, to SQL Server.
What if our applications need refactoring?
We provide modernization services including re-architecture, containerization, API creation, and cloud-native redesign.
How do you ensure data integrity during migration?
We use checksum verification, automated validation, secure encrypted transfers, and post-migration testing.
Can you migrate large workloads with complex dependencies?
We manage multi-tier systems, legacy apps, distributed databases, and multi-cloud transitions.
How long does a typical migration take?
Timelines vary:
    • Simple workloads: 1–3 weeks
    • Medium systems: 4–8 weeks
    • Enterprise migrations: Several months
What visibility will we have during migration?
You receive tracking dashboards, milestone updates, testing reports, and dedicated communication channels throughout the migration.
What happens after the migration is completed?
We perform validation, performance optimization, security hardening, and ongoing monitoring to ensure your cloud environment is stable and efficient.
