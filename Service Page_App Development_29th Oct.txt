FAQs
Do you also handle app design (UI/UX) and branding?
Yes, we offer complete UI/UX design and branding solutions as part of our app development process. Our designers craft visually appealing, user-centric interfaces that reflect your brand identity while ensuring intuitive navigation and smooth interactions across devices.
How long does it take to build a mobile app?
The timeline depends on app complexity, features, and platform choice.
    • Simple apps: 2–3 months
    • Mid-level apps: 3–6 months
    • Complex or enterprise apps: 6+ months
We always provide a clear project roadmap before development begins so you know what to expect at every stage.
How do you handle project milestones and timelines?
We divide each project into milestones, such as design, prototype, development phases, and testing, with defined deliverables and deadlines. Clients receive progress reports and demos at each milestone to review, approve, and stay informed about timelines.
How do you ensure the project stays within budget?
We provide detailed cost estimates after understanding your project requirements. Throughout development, we follow transparent billing, regular progress tracking, and proactive communication to prevent cost overruns. Any new feature requests are discussed and approved before implementation.
What level of involvement will I have during the project?
You’ll be actively involved throughout the process. We maintain regular communication through meetings, demos, and progress reports. You can review deliverables, share feedback, and approve each stage before moving forward.
Do you build native or cross-platform apps — which is better?
We develop both native (Android/iOS) and cross-platform (Flutter, React Native, etc.) apps.
    • Native apps offer superior performance and platform-specific features.
    • Cross-platform apps are faster to build and more cost-efficient for multi-platform deployment.
We recommend the best approach based on your project goals, budget, and timeline.
Can you integrate APIs, third-party tools, or backend systems?
Absolutely. We specialize in integrating APIs, payment gateways, CRM systems, analytics tools, cloud services, and custom backends to extend your app’s functionality and streamline operations.
Do you provide backend development and cloud hosting support?
Yes, our backend developers build secure, scalable architectures to support real-time data, user management, and integrations. We also provide cloud hosting and deployment support using AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, based on your preference.
Can you build apps with AI, AR/VR, blockchain, or IoT features?
Yes, we develop intelligent, next-gen apps using emerging technologies like AI/ML, AR/VR, blockchain, and IoT. These features enhance user engagement, automate tasks, and deliver innovative digital experiences aligned with your business vision.
How do you approach app design and user experience?
We follow a research-driven design strategy. Our UX team studies user behavior, industry trends, and competitors to create intuitive flows. Then, our UI designers craft visually rich, brand-aligned interfaces that maximize engagement and ease of use.
What’s your pricing model — fixed, hourly, or milestone-based?
We offer flexible pricing models:
    • Fixed Price: Best for small projects with clearly defined scopes.
    • Hourly Rate/Time & Material: Suitable for ongoing or evolving projects.
    • Milestone-Based: Payment is linked to completed deliverables.
We’ll help you choose the model that best fits your project goals and budget.
Who owns the app source code and intellectual property rights?
You do. Once the project is completed and payments are settled, full ownership of the source code, IP rights, and related assets is transferred to you.
What happens if I decide to move to another development team later?
No problem. We ensure a smooth handover. You’ll receive all source code, documentation, and credentials so another team can continue from where we left off. We can also assist with transition support if needed.
Can you provide ongoing product strategy or roadmap support?
Yes. Beyond development, we help clients refine their app strategy, plan feature updates, analyze user data, and align the product roadmap with evolving business goals. Our goal is to ensure your app continues to grow and succeed post-launch.
