FAQs
What is API development?
API development involves designing secure, scalable interfaces that allow applications, services, and systems to communicate reliably.
How do you ensure APIs don’t break existing applications during updates?
We follow strict API versioning, backward compatibility policies, and staged rollouts. Changes are released as new versions, validated in staging environments, and deployed with rollback mechanisms to ensure existing applications continue running without disruption.
Can you modernize or rebuild our existing legacy APIs?
Yes. We modernize legacy or poorly documented APIs by refactoring code, improving performance, upgrading security, and redesigning architecture (REST, GraphQL, or gRPC) while preserving existing business logic and integrations.
How do you secure APIs against data leaks and cyberattacks?
We implement enterprise-grade security including OAuth 2.0, JWT, API gateways, encryption in transit and at rest, rate limiting, IP whitelisting, and continuous vulnerability monitoring aligned with OWASP API Security standards.
Do you provide SLAs and long-term API support?
Yes. We offer long-term maintenance with defined SLAs covering uptime, performance monitoring, security patching, version upgrades, and issue resolution to ensure your APIs remain stable and business-ready.
Can your APIs scale with high traffic and growing user demand?
Absolutely. Our APIs are built with cloud-native and microservices architectures, horizontal scaling, load balancing, caching, and auto-scaling to handle high concurrency and traffic spikes reliably.
How do you handle API performance issues and latency?
We proactively monitor APIs using logging, tracing, and metrics. Performance tuning includes query optimization, caching strategies, asynchronous processing, and infrastructure scaling to maintain low latency and high availability.
Will we own the API source code and documentation?
Yes. You retain full ownership of the API source code, documentation, configurations, and intellectual property. We ensure clean handover and transparent documentation for future scalability.
How long does it take to build a production-ready API?
Most production-ready APIs take between 4–12 weeks, depending on complexity, integrations, security requirements, and scale. We provide clear timelines after requirement and architecture assessment.
Can APIs integrate with ERP, CRM, payment gateways, and third-party tools?
Yes. We specialize in building APIs that integrate seamlessly with ERP, CRM, CMS, payment gateways, cloud services, and third-party platforms to ensure smooth, real-time data exchange.
Is API development a one-time project or an ongoing engagement?
API development is typically ongoing. We support continuous optimization, versioning, feature expansion, and security updates to ensure your APIs evolve with your business needs.
