Frequently Asked Questions
What is security testing, and why is it important for my application?
Security testing identifies vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and risks in your web, mobile, or cloud applications. It helps prevent data breaches, malware attacks, unauthorized access, and compliance violations.
What types of security testing do you provide?
We offer a full suite of testing services, including:
    • Vulnerability Assessment (VA)
    • Penetration Testing (Web, Mobile, API, Cloud)
    • SAST/DAST Code Security Analysis
    • Infrastructure & Network Security Testing
How often should security testing be performed?
    • Before every major release
    • After code changes of feature additions
    • After third-party integrations
    • At least once every quarter for high-risk systems
Do you provide both manual and automated penetration testing?
Yes, we combine automated scanning tools with expert-led manual penetration techniques to ensure deep vulnerability detection and real-world attack simulations.
How long does a security testing engagement take?
Depending on scope and complexity, security testing can take 1–4 weeks. Large enterprise systems requiring compliance audits may take slightly longer.
