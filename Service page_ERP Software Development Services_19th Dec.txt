FAQs
How much does custom ERP software development cost?
The cost of custom ERP development depends on factors such as the number of modules, workflow complexity, integrations, deployment model (cloud, on-premise, or hybrid), and security requirements.
Most ERP projects range from mid five figures to six figures, with final pricing determined after requirement discovery and architecture planning.
How long does it take to develop and implement an ERP system?
ERP development timelines vary based on business size and scope.
Typical timelines are:
    • Small businesses: 3–6 months
    • Mid-sized enterprises: 6–12 months
    • Large enterprises: 12–24 months
We follow phased rollouts to ensure stability and faster value realization.
Can you migrate data from our legacy systems without downtime?
Yes. We perform ERP migrations using phased deployment, parallel system runs, data validation, and rollback mechanisms.
This ensures accurate data transfer with minimal or zero operational downtime, even for mission-critical enterprise systems.
Who owns the source code and intellectual property (IP)?
Ownership depends on the engagement model.
 In most custom ERP projects, clients retain full ownership of the source code, data, and IP, with clearly defined usage and redistribution rights outlined in transparent contracts.
Can the ERP scale as our business grows or expands globally?
Absolutely. Our ERP platforms are built using modular architecture, microservices, and cloud-ready infrastructure, allowing seamless scaling across new users, locations, business units, and regions without system rework.
How secure is a custom ERP compared to off-the-shelf solutions?
Custom ERP systems offer higher security control than generic platforms.
We implement role-based access, data encryption, audit trails, secure APIs, compliance frameworks (GDPR, ISO), and regular security testing to protect sensitive enterprise data.
Can your ERP integrate with our existing tools and third-party platforms?
Yes. We integrate ERP systems with CRM platforms, accounting software, payment gateways, logistics tools, marketplaces, and legacy systems using secure APIs to ensure seamless data flow across your business ecosystem.
Do you provide post-launch ERP support and long-term maintenance?
Yes. We offer ongoing ERP support, including performance monitoring, security updates, module enhancements, scalability upgrades, and bug fixes to ensure your ERP evolves with your business needs.
Is a custom ERP better than using platforms like SAP, Oracle, or Odoo?
Custom ERP is ideal when off-the-shelf platforms cannot fully support your workflows, scalability goals, or cost structure.
Unlike licensed ERPs, custom solutions provide greater flexibility, lower long-term costs, full ownership, and tailored functionality without vendor lock-in.
How do we get started with an ERP development project?
The process starts with ERP requirement discovery and technical assessment, where we analyze workflows, integrations, compliance needs, and scalability goals.
Based on this, we provide a clear roadmap, timeline, and cost estimate before development begins.
